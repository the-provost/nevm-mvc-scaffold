Your companion for Node.js app development with a clean MVC structure and a touch of magic!

## Introduction

The **NEVM MVC Scaffolding Tool** is designed to streamline your Node.js application development process by providing you with everything you need to organize your project using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. With this tool, you can quickly set up your project directories, install necessary dependencies, and generate essential files like `server.js`, routes, controllers, models, and more.

## Features

- **Express.js Installation**: Optionally install Express.js for building your backend server.
  
- **ORM Installation**: Choose to install Sequelize or Mongoose as your ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interaction.
  
- **Vue.js with Vite Installation**: Optionally install Vue.js with Vite for building your frontend application.
  
- **Vue Router Installation**: Automatically install Vue Router for frontend routing.
  
- **Simple and Interactive**: The tool provides a simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI) for guiding you through the setup process.
